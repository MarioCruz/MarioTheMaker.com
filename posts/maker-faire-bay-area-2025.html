        <p>This year I had the incredible honor of serving as a <strong>Producer in Residence</strong> at Maker Faire Bay Area, supporting event logistics and hosting the Make: Live Stage across the weekend.</p>

        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>

        <p>Thursday and Friday were all about helping makers with load-in, getting them to their booth locations, and assisting with setup. Friday was especially rewarding—approximately <strong>7,500 students</strong> came through for hands-on exploration, experiencing the maker movement firsthand.</p>

        <p>On Saturday and Sunday, I had the privilege of hosting the <strong>Make: Live Stage</strong>, introducing speakers and makers from across the broader maker community. It was inspiring to share the stage with so many talented creators.</p>

        <h3>Raptor House FX</h3>
        <p>The last maker to highlight is another blue ribbon award winner—Raptor House FX. Their projects are precise, expressive, and beautifully engineered. The Thing hand from Wednesday (Adams family) operated wirelessly via a glove worn by the performer, translating subtle finger and wrist motions into fluid articulation. The grip strength is impressive; it clamped onto my arm with confident, controlled pressure.</p>

        <h2>The Human Side</h2>

        <p>Now the human side is getting to hang out all weekend with Tom and Daisy, my maker brothers and sister, who run Moonlighter Miami and Elise from Vector Space in Lynchburg, Virginia, as well as the Lynchburg Maker Faire. She is fantastic and a loving person, catching up whenever we are together. Also, to the rest of the tremendous crew leading the enormous event with a large number of makers, sponsors, and visitors.</p>

        <p>Special thanks to Dale, Gillian, Katie, Jen, Siana, Cole, Kevin, Jamie and the rest of this amazing crew.</p>

        <p>Being part of Maker Faire Bay Area reminded me why I love this community—the creativity, the willingness to share knowledge, and the constant spirit of iteration and improvement.</p>
