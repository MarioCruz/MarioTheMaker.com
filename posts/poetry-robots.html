        <p>Since 2016, I've been building robots that share poetry with the world. What started as a simple idea — using machines to disseminate poems through technology — has evolved into a family of <strong>Poetry Robots</strong> that have delighted thousands of people at O, Miami Poetry Festival events.</p>

        <h2>The Original Poetry Robots (2016-2018)</h2>

        <p>The journey began with two machines: the <strong>Poem-o-matic</strong> and <strong>Optimus Rhyme</strong>. Both were born at Moonlighter Maker Space and debuted at the O, Miami Poetry Festival.</p>

        <h3>Poem-o-matic</h3>

        <p>The Poem-o-matic is a receipt printer with a soul. Using a curated database of short poems, it prints one poem at a time — at random — with the touch of a button. Each poem tears away just like a receipt and can be taken home. There's something beautifully unexpected about receiving poetry the same way you'd get a grocery list.</p>

        <h3>Optimus Rhyme</h3>

        <p>Optimus Rhyme is a vintage robot repurposed to read poems out loud in his distinctive, sonorous robot voice. Once initiated, Optimus reads all of the poems in his hard drive in random order, over and over, until someone shuts him off. <em>Just like a real poet.</em></p>

        <p>Built from a vintage toy robot shell with custom electronics inside, Optimus became a crowd favorite at festival events. People would gather around to hear what poem would come next, spoken in that wonderfully retro robotic tone.</p>

        <h2>Alphie: Poetry Robot 2.0 (2025)</h2>

        <p>For the 2025 O, Miami Poetry Festival — marking my <strong>12th year of collaboration</strong> with the festival — I introduced <strong>Alphie the Poem Bot</strong>, the next evolution in poetic technology.</p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>Alphie is built from a vintage Alphie educational robot from the 1980s, completely reimagined with modern technology. Unlike his predecessors who could only play back pre-loaded poems, Alphie integrates with AI to create something truly magical.</p>

        <h3>How Alphie Works</h3>

        <p>Created with user-friendly toggle switches, Alphie offers two modes of operation:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Archive Mode</strong> — Press his buttons to hear poems from O, Miami's curated archive</li>
          <li><strong>AI Generation Mode</strong> — Alphie generates original poetry in real-time using a local LLM running on a Raspberry Pi</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The AI component is powered by a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> running a <strong>local Large Language Model</strong>. This means Alphie can create unique poems on the fly — no internet connection required. Every interaction produces something new, making each encounter with Alphie a one-of-a-kind experience.</p>

        <h2>The O, Miami Connection</h2>

        <p>These robots wouldn't exist without <a href="https://omiami.org" target="_blank">O, Miami</a>, the poetry festival dedicated to bringing poetry to every resident of Miami-Dade County. Their mission of making poetry accessible to everyone aligns perfectly with the maker philosophy of using technology to connect people with art.</p>

        <p>Each April, the Poetry Robots appear at various O, Miami events throughout Miami-Dade County, bringing poetry to libraries, parks, and community spaces. The robots serve as a bridge between technology and literature — a reminder that innovation and art can work together.</p>

        <h2>Technical Credits</h2>

        <p>The Poetry Robots are a collaborative effort:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Design & Build:</strong> Mario "The Maker" Cruz</li>
          <li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> <a href="https://moonlighterlabs.com" target="_blank">Moonlighter Maker Space</a></li>
          <li><strong>Original Video:</strong> Jorge Graupera</li>

          <li><strong>Festival Partner:</strong> <a href="https://omiami.org" target="_blank">O, Miami Poetry Festival</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>

        <p>The Poetry Robots continue to evolve. With advances in AI and natural language processing, the possibilities for robotic poetry are expanding. I'm exploring new interactions, new voices, and new ways to surprise and delight festival-goers.</p>

        <p>Because poetry deserves to be everywhere — even coming from the mouths of robots.</p>
