        <p><em>Collaboration across the pond - Mario the Maker from Miami, FL and Docker Captain Alex Ellis from the UK work together on an awesome project.</em></p>

        <p>At the 2016 DockerCon in Seattle, I went to see a talk by Alex Ellis about Docker & IoT: protecting the Datacenter. It was a great talk, and since I had been working on IoT devices myself and was impressed, I decided to check out his blog when I got back home.</p>

        <h2>The Collaboration</h2>

        <p>Alex had just published an excellent blog post on running a time-lapse project with Docker and a Raspberry Pi about the same time I was working on projects for Miami's first full-blown Maker Faire. That was when Alex asked if I would be interested in building a case using the instructions from his blog post for timelapse video using Docker for DockerCon in Austin.</p>

        <p>We wanted to use a WD PiDrive BerryBoot Edition 1TB hard drive in the case so we could store as many photos as we wanted without worrying about running out of space.</p>

        <h2>The Build</h2>

        <p>I thought a shipping container would make the perfect case for everything. Creating the case was a fun experiment of scaling and manipulating the size to keep the Pi and drive snug. This would allow me to minimize the hardware used on the case. I also wanted the case to be collapsible so that Alex could easily transport it back to the UK after the event.</p>

        <p>Double-sided tape was used on an old laptop hard drive caddy to attach the drive to the bottom of the box. For the Pi, I laser cut a bottom piece and then attached the Pi to the laser cut board with screws, while adding double stick tape to the bottom board. The camera was then attached to a special camera hole made for the Pi camera. As a finishing touch, I matched the Docker container theme by adding the DockerCon logo.</p>

        <h2>Making at Moonlighter</h2>

        <p>At Moonlighter Makerspace I have access to a Full Spectrum Laser PRO 24X36. It takes about twenty minutes to cut the case. Before I moved to cut the pattern out in wood, I cut many renditions out of old cardboard. I spent $5.00 for the craft oak plywood, $30.00 for the Raspberry Pi, and the drive was donated by Western Digital.</p>

        <p>Obviously, without the resources at Moonlighter, this project would have been pretty tough to make. Go support your local Maker and Hacker space!</p>

        <h2>Project Files</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/MarioCruz/MakerFiles" target="_blank">Laser Cut Files on GitHub</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/MarioCruz/DockerTimeLapse" target="_blank">Docker Time Lapse Notes on GitHub</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Stay tuned as Alex and I will be collaborating on future projects around IoT, Pi and whatever Alex codes or posts on his blog that I can use to make the next thing.</p>
