          <li>O, Miami</li>
          <li>Opa-Locka Community Development Corporation (OLCDC)</li>

        <p>The Opa Locka Light District project, a winner of a Public Space Challenge grant from the Miami Foundation, uses specially-designed outdoor projectors created by Mario 'The Maker' Cruz and Moonlighter FabLab. Besides displaying original short poems written by local Opa-Locka students and residents, the lamps also add additional illumination to the streetscape with the goal of increasing pedestrian safety.</p>

        <p>The poems were gathered by O, Miami through workshops in Opa-locka community centers and schools. They can be found projected onto the walls and sidewalks of several buildings including the Hurt Building, the City of Opa-locka municipal building, La Granja Grocery Store, and others. Each one addresses topics of light, democracy, public safety, transportation, and infrastructure.</p>

        <p>This project exemplifies how technology and art can come together to serve communities, bringing poetry into public spaces while also addressing practical needs like street lighting and pedestrian safety.</p>
