        <h2>The Response</h2>
        <p>Upon the surge of the Covid-19 pandemic, Moonlighter FabLab served as the South Florida Hub for the Open Source Medical Supplies collective – coordinating volunteers as well as fabricating and distributing PPE for medical facilities and organizations serving populations with vulnerable health conditions.</p>

        <h2>The Impact</h2>
        <p>Locally, our community created and delivered over <strong>18,000 pieces of free PPE</strong>, valued at over <strong>$350,000</strong>. The international maker community connected through the OSMS network manufactured and delivered over <strong>48 million pieces of PPE and medical supplies</strong> valued at over <strong>$271 million dollars</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Legacy</h2>
        <p>This was a landmark example of the power of distributed manufacturing collectives and the capabilities of digital fabrication to solve large scale global challenges. School maker labs, Makerspaces, fablabs, and small manufacturing businesses rose to meet the need when the global supply chain was disrupted.</p>

        <p>Design files were open-sourced and shared freely, a few key components were approved by the NIH, and communities created their own material sourcing, manufacturing, assembly, and distribution supply chain to serve their local regions.</p>

        <p>The entire experience was inspiring – when the world was experiencing a collective distress, people were empowered to make and deliver practical solutions, using their time and skills to make a difference.</p>
