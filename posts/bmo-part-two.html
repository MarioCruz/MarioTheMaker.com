        <p>Getting to the right BMO colors was a little difficult, but thanks to my daughter and a trip to Home Depot, she matched the color 100%! She also helped sand and paint BMO.</p>

        <h2>The Build Details</h2>

        <p>The monitor I used inside BMO was $5 at a yard sale. I needed a 4:3 monitor to keep the correct aspect ratio and went to a few yard sales looking for one.</p>

        <h3>Legs and Feet</h3>
        <p>For the legs I used PVC pipes. Then I laser cut wooden circles and used Gorilla Glue to hold the threaded rods that attach the feet to his body. I drilled a small hole on the wooden circles to run the power into BMO and not have an ugly cord hanging out.</p>

        <p>I foam filled the PVC tubes to add structure and support to the rods and pipes. I 3D printed BMO shoes and hands.</p>

        <h3>Arms</h3>
        <p>For the arms, I just bought a clear hose that had the scale of the BMO arms at the local hardware store. Then I Plasti-Dipped them and painted them blue.</p>

        <p>The shoes allowed about 3 inches of the PVC to extend into the box, allowing me to use hose clamps to attach BMO to the CNC base with the Adventure Time logo.</p>

        <h2>Inside BMO</h2>
        <p>The picture of the inside shows how I attached the speakers using hot glue and supporting them with a 2x2. The Raspberry Pi case is attached to a 2x4 with 3M double stick tape.</p>

        <h2>Miami Maker Faire 2017</h2>
        <p>Finally, BMO was a total hit at the Miami Maker Faire! The kids immediately recognized BMO and came to play video games while the adults came to reminisce and play their retro favorites!</p>
