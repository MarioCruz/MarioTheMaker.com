      <div class="post-content about-content">
        <p>Mario Cruz is an accomplished <strong>technologist</strong>, <strong>entrepreneur</strong>, <strong>inventor</strong>, and <strong>musician</strong> from Miami, FL. As a kid, I would take things apart and mostly put them back together. Then I started fixing musical instruments and building computers — and I was hooked. Today I work out of <a href="https://moonlighterfablab.org" target="_blank">Moonlighter FabLab</a> in Miami, creating robots, IoT devices, and interactive installations that bring technology and creativity together.</p>

        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>I serve as <strong>CTO of Watsco Ventures</strong>, helping HVAC/R entrepreneurs innovate and grow their businesses.

        <h2>Maker Faire Miami</h2>
        <p>I'm the <strong>Executive Producer of Maker Faire Miami</strong>, our flagship event designed to celebrate, educate, and inspire our local maker community. In 2019, the Moonlighter team took over production and we've never looked back. Maker Faire Miami is produced by Moonlighter FabLab, a 501(c)3 Non-Profit Organization dedicated to empowering makers with access to the skills, tools, and opportunities to shape a better future.</p>

        <h2>Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden</h2>
        <p>I serve as a <strong>Technical Advisor for Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden</strong>, designing IoT solutions for their programs. I'm proud to support the <strong>Growing Beyond Earth</strong> initiative — a partnership with NASA that engages students in real space biology research by growing plants in controlled environments and contributing data to help develop sustainable food production for future space missions.</p>
